# intermediate_format.py
# ----------------------
# This file defines the "Intermediate Format" (IF) for data exchange.
#
# - READERS (e.g., Idd3dReader, ArgoverseReader) are responsible FOR CREATING
#   an instance of the main 'IntermediateData' class.
#
# - WRITERS (e.g., NuScenesWriter, KittiWriter) are responsible FOR CONSUMING
#   an instance of the 'IntermediateData' class.
#
# All 'temp_..._id' fields are strings used by the Reader to temporarily
# identify objects (e.g., "frame_0001", "obj_123"). The Writer is
# responsible for converting these into its own token/ID system.
